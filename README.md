# genMDM controller vst
The goal of this VST is to make it much easier to control genMDM in a DAW. This project was inspired by the [Sega Megadrive Synth](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/sega-megadrive-synth) created by Sam Battle (aka LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER). I don't quite have the resources to pull that project off so I decided to make the "tedious computer crap" easier to deal with.

## Project status (2020 Jun 20)
Absolutely buried in UI planning. There are so many parameters available to tweak! Keep an eye out here or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikolyst) for updates. 

## What I'm using
* [Cabbage](https://github.com/rorywalsh/cabbage) - Open source audio software framework based on Csound.
* [Glimpse Image Editor](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse) - A fork of the GNU Image Manipulation program with a name that isn't a derrogatory term.
